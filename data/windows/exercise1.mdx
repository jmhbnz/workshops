Welcome to the OpenShift Windows Containers Workshop! Here you'll have a chance to build your windows container prowess.  

With a Red Hat subscription, you can get support for running Windows workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

For this workshop you'll be given a fresh OpenShift 4 cluster which currently only runs linux containers. You will complete a series of exercises to transform the cluster to be capable to run Windows containers.

**Let's get started!**


## 1.1 - Obtaining your environment

To get underway open your web browser and navigate to the following link to reserve yourself a user https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/98b7pu.  You can reserve an environment by entering any email address along with the password provided by your workshop facilitator.

Open the console url and login.

## 1.3 - Logging into your bastion host

Along with the cluster web console we will also use the command line during this workshop. You've been allocated a bastion host that you can ssh to as part of step 1.1.

Follow the steps below to connect to your environment bastion host:

1. Open your preferrred terminal application.
2. Enter `ssh lab-user@<bastion-hostname>` replacing `<bastion-hostname>` with the hostname listed in your **Bastion Access** environment details page.
3. Enter `yes` if you receive a host key verification prompt. This only appears as it is the first time you have connected to this host.
4. When prompted enter the password mentioned under **Bastion Access** in your environment details page.

Congratulations, you're now ready to proceed with the next exercise 🎉.
