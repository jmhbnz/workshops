We've had a good dig into cluster security and compliance. Let's change gears for this final exercise to get some quick practice deploying [Red Hat Developer Hub](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/overview) in a disconnected cluster.

## 8.1 - Deploying red hat developer hub

Earlier in exercise 3 we deployed the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator. We'll now instruct that operator to deploy an instance of Developer Hub for us by creating a `Backstage` custom resource.

Run the following command in your highside terminal session:

```bash
cat << EOF | oc apply --filename -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: rhdh
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes

---
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: developer-hub
  namespace: rhdh
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
    extraFiles:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
    replicas: 1
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
EOF
```

Once the pods in the `rhdh` namespace are `Ready` we can retrieve and open the `Route` for our new Developer Hub instance and complete our first time login.

```bash
oc get route --namespace rhdh backstage-developer-hub --output jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
```

## 8.2 - Understanding developer hub

With Developer Hub deployed, you will notice by default there isn't much going on in the dashboard. This is because Developer Hub is a platform that has to be specifically customised for your environment through the extraordinary plugin ecosystem.

Take a moment to explore what directions you could potentially take your deployment via the plugin marketplace https://backstage.io/plugins. 

Red Hat support a curated and opinionated set of plugins, you can take a look at those here https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/plugins

We don't have time in this workshop to fully dig into Red Hat Developer Hub however if you do finish the security and compliance focused tasks ahead of schedule please feel free to review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvVOC0mFR_4 to get a feel for how Developer Hub templates can be used.
