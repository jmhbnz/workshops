Now that we have had a tour of the OpenShift web console to get familar, let's use the web console to deploy our first application.

Let’s start by doing the simplest thing possible - get a plain old Docker-formatted container image to run on OpenShift. This is incredibly simple to do. With OpenShift it can be done directly from the web console.

Before we begin, if you would like a bit more background on what a container is or why they are important click the following link to learn more: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers#overview


## 2.1 - Deploying the container image

Within the **Developer** perspective, click the **+Add** entry on the left hand menu.

Once on the **+Add** page, click **Container images** to open a dialog that will allow you to quickly deploy an image.

In the **Image name** field enter the following:

```text
quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest
```

Leave all other fields at their defaults (but take your time to scroll down and review each one to familarise yourself! 🎓)

Click **Create** to deploy the application.

OpenShift will pull this container image if it does not exist already on the cluster and then deploy a container based on this image. You will be taken back to the **Topology** view in the **Developer** perspective which will show the new "Parksmap" application.

## 2.2 - Observing our deployed application

If you click on the **parksmap** entry in the **Topology** view, you will see some information about that deployed application. 

The Resources tab may be displayed by default. If so, click on the Details tab. On that panel, you will see that there is a single Pod that was created by your actions.
