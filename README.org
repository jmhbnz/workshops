This mono repo contains a basic [[https://nextjs.org/][nextjs]] frontend designed to be exported as a static site and served via [[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]].

The frontend is used to serve workshop instructions for custom hands on workshops I have created.

** Local development

To set up a local development environment run the following:

#+begin_src bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and serve the site
npm run build && npm run dev
#+end_src


** Exporting static site

To export the site to static html to serve for example via github pages, run:

#+begin_src bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and export the site
npm run build
#+end_src
